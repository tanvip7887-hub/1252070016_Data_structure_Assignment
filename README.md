# Data Structures Assignments in C++

This repository contains my **Data Structures assignments** implemented in **C++**.  

## Contents
- Programs and solutions for various data structure problems.
- Includes **arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more**.
- Each assignment is in a separate file with clear naming.

## Purpose
- To practice and demonstrate concepts learned in the **Data Structures course**.
- To improve **problem-solving skills using C++**.

## How to Run
1. Open the `.cpp` file in your favorite C++ IDE or compiler.
2. Compile the code.
3. Run the program and follow the instructions.

## Notes
- Each file is **self-contained** and can be run independently.
- Make sure you have a **C++ compiler** installed (e.g., g++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio).
